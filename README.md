## Symbolic disentangled representations in hyperdimensional latent space
### Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023

https://airi.net/ru/articles/symbolic-disentangled-representations-in-hyperdimensional-latent-space/

The idea of the disentangled representations is to reduce the data to a set of gen-
erative factors which generate it. Usually, such representations are vectors in the
latent space, in which each coordinate corresponds to one of the generative fac-
tors. Then the object represented in this way can be modified by changing the
value of a specific coordinate. But first, we need to determine which coordinate
handles the desired generative factor, which can be complex with a high vector di-
mension. In this paper, we propose to represent each generative factor as a vector
of the same dimension as the resulting representation. This is possible by using
Hyperdimensional Computing principles (also known as Vector Symbolic Archi-
tectures), which represent symbols as high-dimensional vectors. They allow us
to operate on symbols using vector operations, which leads to a simple and inter-
pretable modification of the object in the latent space. We show it on the objects
from dSprites and CLEVR datasets and provide an extensive analysis of learned
symbolic disentangled representations in hyperdimensional latent space.

## Neural Robot

We read brain activity using the Emotiv Epoc+ headset. Then we classify into 5 classes: forward, backward, left, right,
neutral. The output of the model is the control signal for the robot.

My contribution to the project was the idea, project management, the selection and implementation of the classifier on
pytorch, data collection, model training, the demonstration of the project at the open house.

## Neural Jedi

In this game you can feel like a real Jedi (provided you have a neuro-headset...) By reading brain signals, the
neuro-headset recognizes whether you are tense now or not. From there you can interact with the game space through
tension: make objects fly up in the air, draw a lightsaber, or release destructive lightning from your hand!

My contribution to the project was the idea, project management, data collection, model training.
